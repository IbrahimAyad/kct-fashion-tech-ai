# ðŸŽ¯ Next Claude Code Session: KCT Dress Shirts Final Integration

## ðŸ“‹ **Session Context**
I just completed implementing the KCT Dress Shirts microservice (20 products: 2 fits Ã— 10 colors). The microservice, backend integration, and frontend are all deployed and working. However, we need to complete the final integration steps.

## ðŸ”¥ **PRIORITY 1: S3 Image Upload (Start Here)**

**Problem**: The 20 dress shirts have placeholder image URLs but no actual images uploaded to S3.

**S3 Structure Already Set Up:**
```
kct-product-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dress-shirts/
â”œâ”€â”€ oxford-white-regular/main.jpg (MISSING)
â”œâ”€â”€ oxford-light-blue-regular/main.jpg (MISSING)
â”œâ”€â”€ oxford-navy-regular/main.jpg (MISSING)
â””â”€â”€ [17 more shirt image folders needed...]
```

**Task**: Upload 20 dress shirt images following the existing pattern:
- **Bucket**: `kct-product-images` (S3 already configured)
- **Folder**: `/dress-shirts/[shirt-slug]/main.jpg`
- **Example**: `/dress-shirts/oxford-white-regular/main.jpg`

**Expected Result**: All dress shirt images load without 403 errors in admin panel.

## âœ… **PRIORITY 2: Backend Integration Testing**

**Current Status**: Backend has environment variable but may need restart to pick up dress shirts.

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Verify dress shirts microservice
curl https://kct-dress-shirts-services-production.up.railway.app/health

# Test backend integration  
curl https://ecommerce-backend-production-5c5a.up.railway.app/api/products?include=shirts

# Test complete integration
curl https://ecommerce-backend-production-5c5a.up.railway.app/api/products?include=native,suits,ties,shirts
```

**Expected Result**: Backend returns 20 dress shirts in unified API response.

---

## ðŸŽ¨ **PRIORITY 3: Admin Panel Complete Testing**

**Frontend Status**: âœ… Deployed with dress shirts support (orange theme)

**Test in Admin Panel**:
1. Go to Products page
2. Select "KCT Dress Shirts" from source filter
3. Verify 20 dress shirts display with "Regular Fit â€¢ White" style badges
4. Check dashboard shows shirts count in summary

**Expected Result**: Complete menswear platform showing Native + Suits + Ties + Dress Shirts.
